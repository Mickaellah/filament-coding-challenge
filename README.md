# Front End Tech Test

## Background information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) including the TypeScript template.

This project is supported by a basic backend using [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).


## Running the project

If you run the following command:

`npm run start`

This will run the backend server on `http://localhost:4000` and it will start the React project on `http://localhost:3000`.

You will find that the backend has a single endpoint:

`GET` `/companies`

This endpoint will return an array of 200 fake companies. You can verify that this is working and running correctly by using your preferred API client such as Postman, Insomnia, etc.

## The task

Your task is to write a React application that fetches the company data from the backend and displays it in a method of your choosing. You could display the companies in a table, or as "cards" on a grid, or a stack, you could implement pagination and only show 10 at a time, the choice is yours!

Start by cloning this repo and committing your changes to your own GitHub repo.

### What we expect from you

- A GitHub repo containing project that fits the brief above, but it doesn't have to be perfect or look amazing! The important thing is that you can demonstrate certain key skills.
- Some information about your project, such as how it works and what it does along with particular instructions on how to run your project
- Demonstrated use of git, such as regular commits
- That you only spend a couple of hours or so on this project. Please let us know how long you have spent when submitting your work. If anything is incomplete, don't worry and please just let us know what you haven't had time to do that you would have liked to in your report.


### Bonus points

Bonus points will be awarded for:

- Using Redux
- Using TypeScript appropriately in your React components or Redux actions/reducers
- Using Material UI, or alternatively `styled-components`


## Good luck!
If at any point you need any guidance or pointers, or if anything doesn't make sense, please get in touch! Otherwise, have fun and good luck!
